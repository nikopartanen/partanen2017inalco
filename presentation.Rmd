We are moving fast to the world where

- Archiving / data managing plans are increasingly demanded as part of project applications
- Submitting the data to an archive is one of the requirements for project's succesful ending

--

Good to keep in mind that there **are no demands on**:

- Quality or consistency of archived materials
- Demands about the usability of this data
- Guaranty that the access is granted
- Security that the long term solution exists for data where access has to be negotiated

--

This is often combined with the interpretation that absolute closedness of the data is obligatory.

# archive â‰  backup

## It is often argued that archive needs more structured data than mere backup of files (Austin 2010: 100) ...

--

## ... but one can still dump there hell of a mess with all fields marked as **missing** or **unknown**

--

## Even doing this is already ok!

## Why this is discussed now so much?

---

## Some reasons

- Esp. digital data tends to disappear (every harddisk will eventually break)
    - I think the lack of proper archiving started to happen already with C-cassettes, as the recording medium became readily available 
- Researcher's get old and die, in some point someone starts to ask where are the recordings
- Reproducibility of scientific work demands that the data is available
- It is non-sensical that externally funded materials would be only in private use
- There are signs that people would be interested about wider comparative research too
    - For example, my work with Komi connects directly to research on Russian dialects and on Tundra Nenets

--

The most important reason is probably that ...

--

- ... Nobody has time and resources to sort someone else's data

If in Helsinki they are still going through M.A. CastrÃ©n's data ...

... then who is going to go through our recordings and when?

### The current situation demands software that is:

- well functioning
- stable
- logical and intuitive to use
- continuously maintained
- thoroughly tested

### Usable for everyone, possibilities to automatization for advanced users

- It is possible to archive with our current setup maybe ten recording sessions in a day
    - I don't have nerves or energy left to more
-    - Anyway the system usually gets stuck into some error in that point and you have to wait one more day
 Once you dump everything to the archive it is next to impossible to do larger changes
- Critical problem is that every action demands several clicks on a mouse
    - With hundreds of files few mistakes will occur
    - Impossible to control what is going on

- The data in the archive starts to diverge from the version researcher(s) use

---

## More complex issues

- We usually use several lapel microphones and a video camera
- This results in large number of files that have to be synchronized
- Older recordings often have all kind of noise that is also good to remove
    - Or more exactly, one has to create distinct versions
    - Ideally information about the alterations and cuts done to different files would also be archived
- Movie industry uses concept called "Edit Decision List" to track this, but I'm not sure how equivalent in language documentation world would look like

# What if I just want to use one recorder?

<p style="clear: both;">

- Roland R26 records several WAV- iles for different microphone pairs etc.
- Tascam DR60 records two WAV files simultaneously, one with lower levels
- etc.

One audio track per recording will disappear, and this is good.

-- Some functionalities are just marketing tricks, but some genuinely help
- However, the cost of this is additional post-processing phase for which there usually is little preparation

--

# Why this matters?

- In few years no high-end recorder will be recording just one track at the time
  Lots of horror in the archiving process has been muted by relatively small datasets and minimal shared use -- this will not remain the case
- "Hard drive space not an issue"
    - Copying terabytes is still slow and annoying
