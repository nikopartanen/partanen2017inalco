I think this should not be the case

.center[## My background]

- I'm no filmmaker
- I'm no anthropologist
- I'm a linguist with few branching interests
- I mainly work with:
    - Dialectal variation in Komi
    - Interaction of Komi and Russian in bilinguals' speech
    - Some questions around language shift
    - Natural Language Processing tools

Instead of movies we produce annotation files, but those have to be linked to something. That something is one possible constellation of available raw data.

## Shallow annotations (Gerstenberger Et. Al. 2017)

---
## Diverse outlets for diffent end users

- DVD's sent to informants
- Web site in Syktyvkar with easy access
- Archive in Nijmegen TLA
- Data connected to different search tools (under construction)

--

## Two perspectives

- Ethical responsibility to guarantee long time preservation of the materials
- Scientific demands for corpus-based and reproducible research

---

We are moving fast to the world where:

- Archiving / data managing plans are increasingly demanded as part of project applications
- Submitting the data to an archive is one of the requirements for project's succesful ending
- Possibly unrealistic, uses foreign terminology, technically challenging
    - If the infrastructure was set properly, this would be a mere afterthough
    - Now wastes hundreds of hours in worktime
    - Not possible to do in a satisfactory manner (in my opinion)

--

Good to keep in mind that there **are no demands on**:

- Quality or consistency of archived materials
- The actual usability of this data
- Security that the long term solution exists for data where access has to be negotiated
- Although this has been discussed for tens of years, we are still far away from more interesting questions

--

This is often combined with the interpretation that absolute closedness of the data is obligatory.

---

.center[## Current discourse]

- It is often argued that archive needs more structured data than mere backup of files (Austin 2006: 100) ...

--

- ... but one can and does still dump there quite a mess with all fields marked as **missing** or **unknown**
- This is better than nothing!

--

- This is further driven by:
    - Extreme difficulty in the use of demanded tools
    - Extreme lack of quality in this software

## Why this is discussed so much?

---

## Some reasons

- Esp. digital data tends to disappear (every harddisk will eventually break)
    - I think the lack of proper archiving started to happen already with C-cassettes, as the recording medium became readily available 
- It is non-sensical that externally funded materials would be only in private use
    - Esp. with endangered languages
- Researchers get old and die
- There have been so many projects now that comparative work should be possible

--

The most important reason is probably that ...

--

- ... Nobody has time and resources to sort someone else's data

--

- ... Work needed to get data into archivable formats increases exponentially starting immediately after the recording is done

If in Helsinki they are still going through M.A. Castrén's data ...

---

... then who is going to go through our recordings and when?

--

.footnote[that said, **we** must produce our data in entirely systematic manner to start with,</br>basically the materials have to be in state that someone can continue **working** with it]

### The current situation demands software that is:

- well functioning
- stable
- logical and intuitive to use
- continuously maintained
- thoroughly tested

### Some possibilities to automatization for advanced users are needed

- In principle archiving should be just a click away
- Keeping everything structured should be part of the workflow on the field

---
class: middle

- It is possible to archive with our current setup maybe ten recording sessions in a day
    - I don't have nerves or energy left to more
- Once you dump everything to the archive it is next to impossible to do larger changes
- Critical problem is that every action demands several clicks on a mouse
    - With hundreds of files few mistakes will occur
    - Impossible to control what is going on

- The data in the archive starts to diverge from the version researcher(s) use

---

## More complex issues

- We usually use several lapel microphones and a video camera
- This results in large number of files that have to be synchronized
- Older recordings often have all kind of noise that is also necessary to remove
    - Or more exactly, one has to create distinct versions
    - Ideally information about the alterations and cuts done to different files is also archived

--
.footnote[usually this information is not even exportable...]

--
- Movie industry uses concept called "Edit Decision List" to track this, but I'm not sure how equivalent in language documentation world would look like

## Original files have to be archived in some format too

## This results in one WAV file and one MPEG4 file

## Without connecting files (EDL) the original files are pretty useless

# What if I just want to use one recorder?

<p style="clear: both;">

- Roland R26 records several WAV files for different microphone pairs etc.
- Tascam DR60 records two WAV files simultaneously, one with lower levels
- etc.

One audio track per recording will disappear eventually.

- Some functionalities are just marketing tricks, but some genuinely help
- However, the cost of this is additional post-processing phase for which there usually is little preparation

---

# Reusable materials, multipurpose data

- Without clearly documented connections between the project output and the primary data these are mainly catch-words
- Who has responsibility to ensure reusability is possible? Or easy?
- Some technical issues have to be solved before the discussion can move forward
