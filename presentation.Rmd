# Why this matters?

- In few years no high-end recorder will be recording just one track at the time
    - Mainly a good development, but costs in extra layer of complexity
- Lots of horror in the archiving process has been muted by relatively small datasets and minimal shared use -- this will not remain the case
- "Hard drive space not an issue"
